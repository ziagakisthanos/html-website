    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
        A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device)<br>
         to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices,<br>
          or a virtual reality headset.<br>
          Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also<br>
          encompasses LAN games, online games, and browser games.
