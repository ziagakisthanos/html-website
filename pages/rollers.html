    <h2>Inline Roller Skating</h2>
    <p>Inline skating is a multi-disciplinary sport and can refer to a number of activities practiced using inline skates. Inline skates typically have two to five polyurethane wheels depending on the style of practice,<br>
         arranged in a single line by a metal or plastic frame on the underside of a boot. The in-line design allows for greater speed and maneuverability than traditional (or "quad") roller skates.<br>
          Following this basic design principle, inline skates can be modified to varying degrees to accommodate niche disciplines.<br>
    Inline skating is commonly referred to by the proprietary eponym rollerblading, or just blading, due to the popular brand of inline skates, Rollerblade.
